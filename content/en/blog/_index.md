Some years ago, when I started to consider astronomy as my professional project, I looked for all the information I could about the life of astronomers. I searched the internet for many people who I knew were involved in astronomy, checked their profiles, what they had done, what they had published, what they had experienced, etc., and my feeling in general was that I could not find people who shared as many details as I wanted. So, I made up my mind that if I ever went into astronomy, I would share as many details as I could about how life had led me to become an astronomer.

This blog is the materialization of that purpose to share my experience. Not to show myself as a role model or because I think I have done excellent, but because maybe someone, like myself a few years ago, just wants to know more about something they like.
